# KubernetesExampleFlask
<sup>By Dan Grecoe a Microsoft Engineer</sup>


This repo contains an example on how to create a basic Flask app and roll it into a Docker container. Take that container and register it with an Azure Container Registry (ACR) and from there create a callable service on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. 

In fact, most of the work has been done already, but it's important to walk throgh the different steps to get from point A to point B. 

Continue on to the source directory to get started. 

## Pre-requisites

- An Azure Subscription in which you can create the required services.
